<p> This week i am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vaccum - sealed in plastic ) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching"</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>.To reserve a seat aty the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
